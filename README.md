# Naming Conventions Relevant to Climate Models

--------------------

This repository will introduce you to some of the major naming conventions needed to make sense of the jungle of climate model output. Specifically, we'll go through some of the names (and long acronyms!) associated with climate _modeling centers_, climate _models_, and the _simulations_ that are performed using those models. Some definitions:

* Climate model: a set of computer codes designed to simulate the climate system, including all of its _components_ (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, rivers, etc.)
* Climate modeling center: a scientific institution dedicated to the creation and maintenance of one or more climate models
* Climate model simulation: a set of output produced by a climate model, which can be associated with various different _configurations_ (changes in greenhouse gas emissions, properties of the atmosphere/ocean/land, etc, etc)


## Climate Modeling Centers

Climate _models_ are developed at research institutions, generally referred to as climate modeling _centers_. These institutions are located in various countries around the world, and are generally funded by relevant federal agencies. For instance, in the US, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado is funded and maintained by the US National Science Foundation.

Climate modeling centers typically employ a multidisciplinary team of researchers, including atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, hydrologists, ecologists, and computer scientists. They use observational data, such as temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric composition measurements, to calibrate and validate their models (more on this elsewhere!). Modeling centers are also responsible for the generation of _simulations_ that are submitted to model intercomparison projects such as CMIP.


## Climate Model Names

When looking for output from climate models, it is important to distinguish between the name of the modeling center which produced the model, and the name of the model itself. The model - meaning the code base describing the physics of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and any other components of the Earth system - will be updated every few years, which is accompanied by a new name each time. Additionally, some modeling centers develop multiple independent models simultaneously; for instance, this is the case at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, where the GFDL-ESM4 (Earth System Model version 4) and SPEAR (Stochastic Parameterization of Eddy Energetics for Renewables), among other models, are currently being used for active research.
