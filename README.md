# Naming Conventions Relevant to Climate Models

--------------------

This repository will introduce you to some of the major naming conventions needed to make sense of the jungle of climate model output. Specifically, we'll go through some of the names (and long acronyms!) associated with climate _modeling centers_, climate _models_, and the _simulations_ that are performed using those models. Some definitions:

* Climate model: a set of computer codes designed to simulate the climate system, including all of its _components_ (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, rivers, etc.)
* Climate modeling center: a scientific institution dedicated to the creation and maintenance of one or more climate models
* Climate model simulation: a set of output produced by a climate model, which can be associated with various different _configurations_ (changes in greenhouse gas emissions, properties of the atmosphere/ocean/land, etc, etc)
